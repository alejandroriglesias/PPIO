Doubts:

Strain? (I guess the NCBI taxonomy ID for each case reaches until the level of strain, so not neccesary maybe)
Host_NCBI_Taxonomy_ID? (not neccesary as a class, if the species is going to be automatically obtained)
Pathogen_NCBI_Taxonomy_ID? (same as with Host_NCBI_Taxonomy_ID)
Pathogen_species? (same as previous)
PHI-base_accession_no? (to acknowledge PHI. In phidump.txt, is "Phi accesion number")
