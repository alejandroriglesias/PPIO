	-NT_sequence.

1.1) has_sequence.
	-has_AA_sequence.
	-has_NT_sequence.

2) gene (this class will englobe others, like accesion, essential_gene, function, gene name, locus ID, Â¿phenotype of mutant?)
	-gene name.
	-function.
	-locus ID.
	-accesion?
	-essential_gene_Lethal_knockout?
	-phenotype of mutant?
	-experimental_evidence?

2.2) has_gene:

	- has_function
	- has_locus_ID
	- has_accesion
	- has_essential_gene_(lethal_knockout)
	- has_mutant_phenotype

3) disease name (maybe merge with phenotypic process).

3.3) has_disease_name.

4) experimental_host (merge with host_plant?)

5) host_response (merge with resistance/susceptibility_phenotype?)

6) reference.
	- has_reference.
	- has_literature_source/ID?.

7) Host_NCBI_Taxonomy_ID and Pathogen_NCBI_Taxonomy_ID (all the new organisms we are going to extract) should be in the NCBITaxon_1 class.
