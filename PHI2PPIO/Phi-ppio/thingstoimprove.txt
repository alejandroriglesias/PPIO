1) Context, host context and pathogen context classes: comment, definition or description.

2) Essential gene lethal knockout. Add description -> PHI-tag description: lethal effect from gene disruption.

3) Experimental evidences out.

4) gene mutation parameter: comment, definition or description. Specify is "ours" (not from PHI-base).

5) host response: Add description -> PHI-tag description: details any difference in the host defence response to a pathogen with a disrupted gene.

6) host target -> import Cellular Component Ontology??

7) host target: comment, definition or description.

8) in vitro growth. Add description-> PHI-tag description: Growth defects in culture caused by the gene disruption e.g. reduced growth.

9) pathogenic interaction. Add description -> composed of three components: plant pathogenic entity, host plant and gene involved.

10) phenotype outcome. Change description to -> description of the different phenotypes observed after the mutagenesis of the gene/s of interest.

11) phi-base accession. Add description -> PHI-tag description: stable accession number for each database entry to aid curation.

12) all host species with scientific names (map with scientific_names.txt)

13) in vitro growth mapping?


Things to improve in PHI itself:

1) Common names of organisms -> only allow scientific names entries.

2) Control over capitalization of names, hyphen/low hyphen names ,etc -> urgent refinement!

3) Allow entries with "null" pathogen / "null" host??
